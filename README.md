**REMITA K11 TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION**

This document outlines the steps involved in processing transactions using the Remita K11 terminal.

### **Steps**

1. **Initialize Remita K11:**  
   * Begin by setting up the Remita K11 terminal for transaction processing.  
2. **Process Card Transaction:**  
   * Call the `ProcessCardTransaction` method with the required inputs: `amount`, `transaction reference`, and `currency`.  
   * **Key Exchange:**  
     * Call the `keyExchange` method to retrieve the master and pin keys.  
     * Inject the master and pin keys into the terminal.  
     * Read the card details.  
3. **Request Card PIN:**  
   * Prompt the client to enter their card PIN.  
4. **Transaction Execution:**  
   * Remita processes the transaction and debits the card if the card details are valid.  
5. **Return Response:**  
   * Remita returns either a successful or a declined response, including the card details.

## **Methods and Functions**

This section details the methods and functions used in the transaction process.

### **Get Device Serial Number**

* **Description:** Returns the serial number of the device. Returns an empty string if the app is running on a non-K11 device or if an error occurs.

**Usage:**

| val serialNumber \= RemitaK11.getSerialNumber() |
| :---- |

**Key Exchange** 

* **Description:** Loads Remita master and pin keys into the K11 terminal.  
* **Method:** `keyExchange`

**Usage:**  
val remitaK11 \= RemitaK11(this, EnvType.Test, apiKey \= "yourApiKey")

*   
  * **Note:** The activity must extend `FragmentActivity`.  
  * **Prod:** EnvType.Live for prod.
  * **Exception:** May throw a `RuntimeException` if the api key is not valid.

### **Process Card Transaction**

* **Description:** Reads card details and charges the card. The `keyExchange` method must be called before a card transaction. The `processCardTransaction` method will call `keyExchange` if it hasn't been invoked yet.  
* **Method:** `processCardTransaction`  
* **Parameters:**

| Parameter | Data Type | Additional Details | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| amountInKobo | long |  | The amount to be charged from the card (in kobo) |
| transRef | String |  | Client’s unique identifier for the transaction |
| currencyCode | String |  | ISO 4271 (e.g “NGN”) |

| transactionDescription | String |  | A 50 character (max) description of the transaction |

* **Usage:**

remitaK11.processCardTransaction(  
               amountInKobo \= 1000, //10 naira  
               transRef \= "yourUniqueTransactionReference",  
	          currencyCode \= “NGN”,  
			transactionType \= TransactionType.purchase  
			transactionDescription \= “55 inches Smart tv purchase”  
               )

Interface: **RemitaCardTransactionListener**

This interface provides updates regarding the transaction process.

* **Implementation Example:**

| class MainActivity : FragmentActivity(), RemitaCardTransactionListener {    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)        val remitaK11 \= RemitaK11(this, secretKey \= "yourSecretKey")        remitaK11.setRemitaCardTransactionListener(this)    }} |
| :---- |

* **Transaction Response Handling:**

| override fun onRemitaCardTransactionResponse(response: CardTransactionResponse) {    this.runOnUiThread {        when (response.transactionState) {            TransactionState.INSERT\_CARD \-\> {                Toast.makeText(this, "Please insert your card.", Toast.LENGTH\_SHORT).show()            }            TransactionState.CARD\_INSERTED \-\> {                Log.d("CARD\_INSERTED", "Card inserted, PIN fragment will load automatically")            }            TransactionState.READ\_CARD\_FAILED \-\> {                Toast.makeText(this, "Failed to read card.", Toast.LENGTH\_SHORT).show()            }            TransactionState.FAILED \-\> {                Toast.makeText(this, "Transaction failed.", Toast.LENGTH\_SHORT).show()            }            TransactionState.TRANSACTION\_SUCCESSFUL \-\> {                Log.d("TRANSACTION\_SUCCESSFUL", response.transactionData.toString())            }            TransactionState.TRANSACTION\_NOT\_SUCCESSFUL \-\> {                Log.d("TRANSACTION\_NOT\_SUCCESSFUL", response.transactionData.toString())                Toast.makeText(this, "Transaction not successful.", Toast.LENGTH\_SHORT).show()            }            else \-\> {                Toast.makeText(this, "Transaction not successful.", Toast.LENGTH\_SHORT).show()            }        }    }} |
